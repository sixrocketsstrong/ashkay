		Today marks the release of ashkay 0.6. Why 0.6 on a new project? Well, ashkay has been around an in production
		for a long time on a number of my own little home projects. I wrote it, I maintain it. The most recent
        incarnation has come from another project of mine, xot. I kept adding features and fixing small defects and
		needed a new release of xot to maintain it. So, I forked it to it's own project. And, here it is.
