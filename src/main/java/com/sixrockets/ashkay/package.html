	 Ashkay is a strategy based caching tool. In most cases, you might be using a configuration file to tell the cache what
	 rules it should obey. Or, you might just be setting properties on the cache. I have never liked this model as it limits
	 me, the user of the cache to strategies the developer decided were important. Instead, Ashkay lets you choose the
	 strategy(ies) to use when caching certain objects. Of course, a few of the most handy strategies are pre-packaged, but
	 implementing a new one is a simple as can be.

	 <h3>Standalone or Factory</h3>
	 Creating a usable cache is simple:
	 <pre>
		<a href="net/sf/ashkay/ObjectCache.html">ObjectCache</a> cache = new ObjectCache();
	 </pre>
	 At this point, you have complete control over the cache. Methods such as <code>put(Object, Object)</code>,
	 <code>get(Object)</code>, etc. allow you to use the cache in any manner you want. Of course, just like this, the
	 ObjectCache is little more than a HashMap. The first thing you might want to do is ask the cache to delegate to a
	 factory if the object you are looking for is not in the cache. You can do this by passing an object that implements the
	 <a href="net/sf/ashkay/ObjectFactory.html">ObjectFactory</a> interface into the cache during construction:
	 <pre>
		ObjectCache cache = new ObjectCache(new SomeFactory());
	 </pre>
	 Once this is done, any call to get an object from the cache that would return null or the cache entry is invalid, will
	 call the <code>createObject()</code> method of the specified factory. So, for example, if you have a Person object that
	 you want cached, your Person class might look like:
	 <pre>
		public class Person {
			private static ObjectCache cache = new ObjectCache(new PersonFactory());

			private String name;
			public Person(String name)
			{
				this.name = name;
			}

			public static Person findPerson(String name)
			{
				return cache.get(name);
			}
		}
	 </pre>
	 The PersonFactory class would be:
	 <pre>
		public class PersonFactory implements ObjectFactory {
			public Object createObjectFor(Object key, Object data)
			{
				return new Person((String) key);
			}
		}
	 </pre>
	 When you make a call to <code>cache.get()</code> passing in a name that is not in the cache, then the cache will ask the
	 PersonFactory to create the Person. Then, before returning the Person to the calling code, the cache prepares the entry
	 and adds it to the cache.
	 <br>
	 <h3>Strategies</h3>
	 With or without an ObjectFactory, the cache is still a little more than a glorified HashMap without some way of expiring
	 a cache entry, or hint that an entry should be re-loaded. This is the work of the <code><a href="net/sf/ashkay/CachingStrategy.html">CachingStrategy</a></code>
	 implementations. An ObjectCache may have 0 to many strategies associated with it. When an object is put into the cache,
	 or a factory creates one, that object is wrapped in an internal <code>CacheEntry</code> and each strategy is asked to
	 <code>prepare</code> the entry. It may do nothing, or it may set a property on the entry, or, it may even return a whole
	 new CacheEntry, wrapping the old one. Each subsequent call to <code>get</code> the object from the cache will ask each
	 strategy to <code>verify</code> the entry. If any strategy fails, the object is reloaded from the factory, or null is
	 returned.
	 <br>
	 CachingStrategies are very simple and can be combined together to perform very sophisticated caching implementations.
	 Prepackaged with ashkay are several common strategies:
	 <dl>
		<dt><a href="net/sf/ashkay/strategies/NullCachingStrategy.html">NullCachingStrategy</a></dt>
		<dd>Caches nothing. The size method will not work right in this strategy as the NullCachingStrategy actually just
		uses a SoftReferenceCachingStrategy but returns false on all verifies.</dd>
		<dt><a href="net/sf/ashkay/strategies/FullCachingStrategy.html">FullCachingStrategy</a></dt>
		<dd>Always returns true from verify.</dd>
		<dt><a href="net/sf/ashkay/strategies/SoftReferenceCachingStrategy.html">SoftReferenceCachingStrategy</a></dt>
		<dd>For memory sensative situations, a SoftReferenceCachingStrategy wraps each object in a SoftReference allowing it
		to be garbage collected if need be,</dd>
		<dt><a href="net/sf/ashkay/strategies/LastModifiedCachingStrategy.html">LastModifiedCachingStrategy</a></dt>
		<dd>Checks the last modified time on a resource. If it has been modified, it will fail verification.</dd>
		<dt><a href="net/sf/ashkay/strategies/TimeExpirationCachingStrategy.html">TimeExpirationCachingStrategy</a></dt>
		<dd>Expires an extry after a designated time.</dd>
	 </dl>
	 How might you combine these. Let's say you are caching XSL Transforms. They are expensive to create so caching them
	 makes a lot of sense. But, if you are reading them from a file, you would like to have the update when the file changes;
	 And, you don't want them hanging around if they are not used much. You can create a factory that creates a transform
	 from a filename that is a key. When you create the object cache, just add both strategies; SoftRefernce for memory and
	 LastModified to take care of the file changing. Easy peezy.
